Zach was instrumental in helping write the Istio tutorials and in particular the Istio Mixer Exercises.

####  Kelsey Hightower [@kelseyhightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower)
The Istio Ingress Tutorial is largely based on the work of Kelsey and this repository:

[https://github.com/kelseyhightower/istio-ingress-tutorial](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/istio-ingress-tutorial)

Kelsey's tutorial uses more advance features of Kubernetes to taint some of the nodes so that the ingress controller runs on dedicated nodes. The ingress controller is then deployed as a daemonset.
